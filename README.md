Project Title: Use Reinforcement Learning to Fine-Tune 0.5B and 3B Models.

Idea: Select some instruct model like qwen2.5 0.5b, 3b, llama3 0.5b, llama 3b. 
Use the instruct version so that the models are already cold started. 

Test their performance on GSM8K. Then use the PPO and GRPO algorithm to do reinforcement learning on their performance. After the reinforcement learning, test their performance in the same GSM8K. Also test them on other mathematics bench mark like MATH. The whole project's goal is relatively humble because many unseen problems are expected.
